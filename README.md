# Gym Class Booking Automation

This repository contains an automated script to book gym classes using Playwright. The script logs into the gym's online portal, finds the scheduled class, and attempts to book it. If the class is full, it will notify you via Slack and retry later if necessary.

## üöÄ Features
- **Automated Gym Booking**: Automatically books your specified classes.
- **Waitinglist Handling**: Detects when you're placed on the waitlist.
- **Slack Notifications**: Sends alerts when bookings succeed, fail, or when you're added to the waitinglist.
- **GitHub Actions Support**: Runs daily at 6:55 am via GitHub Actions.
- **Error Handling**: Captures unexpected issues and alerts via Slack.

```

## ü§ñ Automate with GitHub Actions
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Store Secrets in GitHub**
Since `.env.local` isn't committed to Git, store sensitive values in **GitHub Secrets**:

2. Add the following secrets:
   - `GYM_URL`
   - `GYM_EMAIL`
   - `GYM_PASSWORD`
   - `CLASS_SCHEDULE`
   - `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Enable GitHub Actions**
The script runs automatically at `6:55 AM UTC` daily. To enable:
1. Create `.github/workflows/gym_booking.yml`.
2. Add the following workflow:
```yaml
name: Gym Class Booking Automation

  schedule:
    - cron: '55 6 * * *'  # Runs daily at 6:55 AM UTC
